Test case 1: There is only one friend who requires five pieces. If he orders one cake, he will get only four pieces. Thus, at least two cakes should be ordered with the necessary number of pieces. Test case 2: Two friends require six pieces each. Thus, a total of 12 pieces are needed. To get 12 pieces, they should order three cakes. Test case 3: Four friends require three pieces each. Thus, a total of 12 pieces are needed. To get 12 pieces, they should order three cakes. Test case 4: Three friends require five pieces each. Thus, a total of 15 pieces are needed. To get 15 pieces, they should order at least four cakes.
